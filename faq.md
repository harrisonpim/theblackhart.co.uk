# FAQ, terms & conditions

## Custom or Core Collection? What's the difference?

Every TBH piece is carved and cast by hand, to-order, in the UK.

Core collection pieces use existing designs, which are then re-carved and fit to your size.

With bespoke orders, designs incorporate your own ideas and every step of the process happens in consultation with you. Custom orders are never reproduced - by commissioning a piece rather than buying from the core collection, you're ensuring that your design is one of a kind.

## Materials

TBH pieces are typically cast in .925 recycled sterling silver. Recycled- or eco-silver is just as precious as new silver, but uses recycled metal.

All TBH designs can be cast in other metals - please get in touch to get a quote. For reference, casting pieces in 9ct gold typically costs 30x the listed price in silver, with some additional costs for finishing.

We don't currently work with precious stones, as they're expensive and hard to source ethically, though this is something we'll be working to enable.

The waxes, polishes and treatments used to create and finish jewellery are all vegan and our packaging is all recycled or from sustainable sources.

## Ring Sizing

Have a look at our [ring sizing guide](/ring-sizing).

## Shipping/postage

Everything we offer at The Black Hart is hand-carved and cast to order, so you can expect to wait few weeks from the date you order to receiving a shipping confirmation.

In the UK, pieces are shipped with [Royal Mail (signed for first-class)](https://www.royalmail.com/sending/uk/signed-for-1st-class). Shipping for international orders will vary.

## Payments

We never see your payment details ourselves. Whenever you buy something from TBH, you'll be directed to a Square checkout link. Square handle the payments, we handle the rest.

## Returns

Because everything at The Black Hart is made to order, we don't offer returns. However, we'll do everything we can to make sure you're satisfied with your purchase - if there is an issue with something you received, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@theblackhart.co.uk).

## Data, GDPR, etc.

We'll always try to minimise the data we need to collect from you, and we'll never use it for purposes other than those described here.

We don't track anything you do on our website, and you don't need to create an account with us to make an order. All our orders are processed by Square, and shipped with Royal Mail in the UK.

When you make an order, you'll need to provide us with:

- an email address, so that we can confirm your order and keep you up to date with the production and shipping process.
- a postal address, so that we can send you your finished piece. We also send out a free selection of art, stickers and other presents to everyone who has ordered from us in the last year.
  If you don't want to be included in that group, just [email us to opt out](mailto:hello@theblackhart.co.uk). We'll scrub this list at the end of each year.
- If you're ordering a bespoke piece, you'll also need to provide a phone number so that we can have an initial chat as part of your consultation.
