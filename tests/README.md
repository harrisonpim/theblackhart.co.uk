# Testing

These E2E tests are written using [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [jest](https://jestjs.io/).

They're based on user stories and the real functionality of the site, not abstract component or function interfaces etc

This ensures that the tests are resilient to changes in underlying implementation, and that they're testing the features of the site which actually matter to users.
