# Testing

These E2E tests are written using [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [jest](https://jestjs.io/).

They're based on [user stories](./user-stories/) and the real functionality on the site, not abstract component functionality.

This ensures that the tests are resilient to changes in underlying implementation, and that they're testing the functionality/features of the site which actually matter.
